description: A little more information about your favourite Jono...
---

I am Jono. Full-stack web developer, agile coach, game programmer, coffee addict... I spend my days making small prototypes, volunteering at my local codeclub and learning.

+ Scared of long term commitment (read as agile mindset).
+ Known for enthusiasm even when it isn't called for.
+ Adept at working in a convoluted codebase (read as loves deleting code).
+ Confident in achieving the impossible.
+ Can learn anything and looks for excuses to do so.
