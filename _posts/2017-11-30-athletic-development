I stumbled upon something called Athletic Development just a few weeks ago and it looks very cool.

Before I start, there is guide for it availble <a href="https://www.athleticcoalition.com/docs/athlete-guide.pdf">here</a>.

I have been working with Scrum for a number of years now. There are some bits that I love and some bits that I find difficult to convince people of if they have a fixed mindset. One of the things I like about Athletic Development is just how extreme it is in these areas, it helps to convey just how important certain aspects are.

If you can convince a team to try athletic development then I think it could offer several advantages

### 1. Cross Skilled Teams.

Moving from I-shaped to T-shaped is hard. In Scrum we have all the skills necessary in the team so that we can do the job, but sometimes you have a front end heavy sprint or you make a change that requires tons of regression testing. And so the skills workload becomes unbalanced, if your team is not ready and stuck in a fixed mindset this becomes a blocker. In a new Scrum Team this is escalated externally and may be handled with more resource, or the risk of the work being delayed is accepted. But if this was an Athletic Coalition then "No one works on anything alone" and "We donâ€™t divide and assign tasks by skillset."

This is something that can help a new team cross skill and I wish this was explicitly part of Scrum. It also makes it easy for the whole team to feel commitment and ownership of the sprint, because they are all working on everything.

Continuous learning is awesome.

### 2. Extreme Increments

The team delivers value daily. Not in two weeks but every afternoon we can show something off to stakeholders.

### 3. No more Product Owner

It is not like there is no Product Ownership. There is, but the whole team do it. This takes the idea of ownership and empowerment much further than Scrum.
