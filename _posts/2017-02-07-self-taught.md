So let's preface this with some facts, I make a bunch of things. My [Github report card](https://githubreportcard.reflect.io/) says that in 2016 "I made 372 commits across 28 GitHub repos in 5 languages". People ask me why I do it, like "Jono you spend 40 hours a week coding already, why go home and do more?". It's because I love it, sure I could go home and watch TV, play video games or hang out with friends (by the way I do all of these things - just maybe less than other people).

Where are you going with this Jono?

Motivation. When I talk about self learning, remember that motivation is key to doing something. I worked in retail and one year as we started getting ready for the dreaded christmas period my manager told us this quote...

>Enthusiasm is one of the most powerful engines of success. When you do a thing, do it with all your might. Put your whole soul into it. Stamp it with your personality. Be active, be energetic and faithful and you will accomplish your goal. Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm. - Ralph Waldo Emerson

This has stuck with me ever since. It is hard to find motivation, sometimes even with things that you love. But going head first at 110% is something I at least find easier to do. It gets me through the rough patches. 

I have two other learnings from this though.

Firstly just because you are enthusiastic it doesn't mean you will succeed, if there are external forces at work there is always a chance of failure, even if you do everything the best you could have. Secondly it helps to have people around, if no one can see your enthusiasm it doesn't really count for much. But if you are in a group people quickly notice it and the effect it can have on others is immense. Thirdly (yolo) disclaimer for burn out, I went 110% for 2 months non stop and it nearly broke me, don't do it.
