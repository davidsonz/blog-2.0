Firstly sorry, I hope it doesn't happen, but if this becomes lame at any time please stop reading and go find something more interesting.

Great, disclosure out of the way.

So let's preface this with some facts, I make a bunch of things. My [Github report card](https://githubreportcard.reflect.io/) says that in 2016 "I made 372 commits across 28 GitHub repos in 5 languages". People ask me why I do it, like "Jono you spend 40 hours a week coding already, why go home and do more?". It's because I love it, sure I could go home and watch TV, play video games or hang out with friends (by the way I do all of these things - just maybe less than other people).

Where are you going with this Jono?

There isn't really any more to say. But when I talk about self learning in a bit this is key. Having motivation to do something is key. I once worked in retail and one year as we started getting ready for the dreaded christmas period my manager told us this quote...

>Enthusiasm is one of the most powerful engines of success. When you do a thing, do it with all your might. Put your whole soul into it. Stamp it with your personality. Be active, be energetic and faithful and you will accomplish your goal. Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.
>Ralph Waldo Emerson
