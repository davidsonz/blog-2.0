description: How do you know your salary is fair? Is market rate?

“We are an industry leading company and we commit to paying you fairly relative to the market and to similar roles within the company”. Most companies will make a claim like this, but very few actually back it up with the information neither publically nor internally available.

Recently I have questioned as to why we hide salary information?

My go to question is for anything like this is "Does it align with the companies values?". I suppose this relies heavily on  your company values and how differently they feel from what is stated. But usually theres is something about trusted, open...

Let's look at the pros and cons for being open about the salaries of our staff.

+ The quoted statement above is no longer assumed, but is truth.
+ Effectively pushes to eliminate wage discrimination and the gender wage gap.
+ Builds trust within the organisation.

- Could be considered as a breach of privacy for some.
- Makes salary negotiation hard and it becomes more difficult to attract people that want more than the market rate.
- Easy for competitors to poach your top employees, they know exactly how much to offer.

What have I not considered?

Is there a simple approach that has the best of both worlds? Could the data be anonomized and aggregated in such a way that people didn't feel identifiable? But would the benefits be as effective?

What do you think?
