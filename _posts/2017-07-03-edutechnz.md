Recently I had the honour of attending the annual NZTech Education Technology Summit on behalf of [Codeclub Aotearoa](https://codeclub.nz).

The summit is a gathering of educators, digital leaders, technologists and innovators with the purpose of sharing their expertise and insights on education. There were two streams that ran over the two days, one focussing on Tech and Pedagogy, and the other on Edtech for Export. My focus was largely on the prior as my interests were around seeing what I could do to benefit the children at my local Codeclub.

There were some pretty awesome takeaways too that I would like to share. The first was the way in which classrooms and the methods of teaching are changing dramatically, to the point where I wish I was back at school. My second takeaway is to the skills and content they are teaching, there is a far bigger push to teach the skills like adapability and autonomy that will help them hugely in the future.

### Teaching is changing...

And it's about time, for too long has it been a teacher at the board with rows and rows of children spaced apart so they can't interact. When I heard the story of Nikki Urlich from Campbell's Bay School has developed an ILE (Innovative Learning Environment) where the learners are front and centre, to the point where they lead their own learning.

She talked about students that at the start of a week would go and pick their own learning objectives. Of course some Maths and Literacy is mandatory, but the students are given free reign to plan their week. Some like to work with a friend on something fun in the beginning to brighten their Monday while others will try to slog through the tough ones early to free themselves up later in the week.

In Nikki's classrooms the teachers act as facilitators trying to draw conversation out of a students to solve a problem or removing blockers so that students can get on with their autodidacticism. So whether it is Khan Academy, Mathletics or Literacy Shed, the students just need to provide the teach with some evidence of their learning and they can move onto their next challenge.

### Preparing the next generation for something that doesn't yet exist

Right now we are in a time of rapid change and crazy growth. There was a lot of discussion about how to best prepare students for their future employment if 65% of todays children will eventually be employed in jobs that are yet to be created.

Nikki's ILE guides students to pick up skills like autonomy, but Nick Pattison at Kauri Flats School takes it one step further. The students at Kauri Flats turn their learning objectives into projects and work closely with the community to see it through. The students use design thinking to work with their customer in the community and iterate to make something that can add value.

These students learn to empathise and define their customers needs, then put those insights to use ideating, protoyping and testing ideas. Teaching kids that you can't expect to get it right on the first try and that every failure is a success in learning are crucial lessons that they are taught not by a teacher, but through their experiences. Practical knowledge of Stanford's Design Thinking tools and processes is highly sort after in the job market today and these kids half my age have a better looking CV that me.

### In Summary

I don't know if it was my rose tinted lenses or something else, but everything people were saying was along the lines of "Agile, we need more Agile". And I'm not saying that it is the solution to everything, but pretty much everyone at this Technology Education Summit was saying something like "Technology alone won't solve the problems in the classroom".

Thanks for reading, ka kite ano!
