One month ago today I received a 3D printer, it was something I have been wanting for ages and I researched tons before ordering it.

## What I learned

  + Bed adhesion and first layer is everything. If the first layer that goes down isn't sticking then the print will fail, there is very little chance of recovery.
  + Finishing processes in the world of 3d printing can make things look production like if you put the effort in. Techniques like acetone smoothing or simply lots of sanding can go a long way, and some nice paint will make things look super great.
  + The limitations in 3D printing inspire a lot of creativity. I could write a whole blog post on this itself.
